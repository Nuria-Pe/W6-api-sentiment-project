If you want real change in healthcare, at the end of the day, you’re going to have to take on the insurance companies, and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all, not huge profits for the insurance companies. You’re going to have to take on the drug companies, and their corruption, and their price fixing, and tell them, “Sorry, we’re not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs, than do the people of other country.” But at the end of the day, there’s no way around it.

It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word “climate change,” to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage.
